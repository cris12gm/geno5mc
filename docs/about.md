# About geno<sup>5</sup>mC

geno<sup>5</sup>mC is a database and web-server to explore the associations between DNA methylation and the genotype. Using 58 publically available whole genome bisulfite sequencing datasets we determine sequence variation and methylation state at a single cytosine resolution by means of MethylExtract2. Statistically significant associations (FDR <= 0.05) are determined by means of a Fisher Exact test.
